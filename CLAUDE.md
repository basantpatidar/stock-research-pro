## Critical Rules (apply to every change)

1. **Tools never raise** — always `return {"error": "..."}` on failure, never `raise`
2. **One tool per file** — `backend/app/tools/<name>.py`, import in `graph.py` ALL_TOOLS
3. **LLM swap = one env change** — change `MODEL_TYPE` in `.env.shared`, zero code changes
4. **Saver mode bypasses all token limits** — by design, do not add guards for it
5. **Every change** → update the relevant `docs/` file + add a line to Recent Changes below
6. **Guard rail limits** live only in `backend/app/services/usage/limits.py` — edit nowhere else
7. **Reading docs** → NEVER read a full `docs/*.md` file. Use the nav map above to find the right file, `grep -n "SEC:ANCHOR" docs/file.md` to get the line, then `Read` with `offset`+`limit` for that section only. Full reads waste ~2k tokens per file.
8. **All other operating rules** live in `docs/rules.md` — branching, commits, PR cadence, no AI attribution, TZ convention, etc. Read it before any non-trivial change. Add new rules there as they emerge.

## Recent Changes

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-05-16 | Telegram bot planned: two-sprint design (Sprint 1 outbound-only, Sprint 2 inbound commands). WhatsApp rejected (paid/ToS issues). Telegram Bot API chosen (free, two-way, official). Default exec mode = saver. Full command set: `/scan`, `/scan loose/mcf/dip`, `/mode saver\|normal\|deep`, `/status`, `/report`, `/research TICKER`, `/watchlist`, `/add`, `/remove`, `/alerts`, `/usage`, `/pause [duration]`, `/resume`, `/help`. Inline keyboard buttons on signal cards. Three scheduled pushes: pre-market 9 AM ET, EOD 4:35 PM ET (extends existing job), weekly Sunday 8 PM ET. File delivery: EOD JSON as Telegram document → forward directly to Claude Code. Architecture: `notifier.py` (outbound) + `telegram_handler.py` (inbound long-poll). Hooks into `alert_engine.py`, `mcf_scanner.py`, `scheduler.py`. New env vars: `TELEGRAM_ENABLED`, `TELEGRAM_POLL_INTERVAL` (in `.env.shared`), `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` (in `.env`). Full plan in `local_debugging/telegram_plan.md`. |
| 2026-05-16 | News relevance filtering (`feat/news-relevance-filtering`): reconciled stash WIP (`ac90942b`) onto main. `_resolve_query` in `news.py` split into `_resolve_company_name` + `_build_query` + new `_relevance_score` (0–10, checks title/desc for ticker + company-word matches, avoids short-ticker false positives). `get_news_impact` now scans 20 articles (was 15), scores each, drops `relevance_score == 0` articles, sorts remaining by relevance, caps response at 10, returns `filtered_count`. `NewsPanel` gains `filteredCount` prop — shows amber-dot indicator "X off-topic articles filtered" + description under each headline + source/date in header row. `EarningsHistoryPanel`: `beat_count`/`miss_count` null-coalesced so NaN can't appear. `ResearchPage`: extracts `newsFiltered` from tier1 and passes to `<NewsPanel>`. `NewsItem` type gets `relevance_score?: number`. |
| 2026-05-16 | MCF loose gate mode + recording: `scan_mcf_opportunities(loose=True)` relaxes tide threshold (−0.30%, 2-of-4 ETFs), volume multiplier (1.05×), support distance (0.50 ATR), target (0.75%), score 75 (vs 90 strict). `POST /mcf-scanner/force-run` accepts `{ loose_gates: bool }` — both paths write to DB; loose alerts tagged `loose_gates=true` on `ScannerAlert`. Migration `a1b2c3d4e5f6` adds `loose_gates` bool column. `GET /mcf-scanner/analytics?loose=bool` separates strict vs loose win rates. `auto_trade.py` filters `loose_gates IS NOT TRUE` so loose signals can never trigger paper/live orders. Frontend: refresh flow unified (always calls `fetchData`), separate Loose Gate Results section with its own win-rate stats, LOOSE badge on alert rows, updated amber banner. SEC:MCF_ROUTES added to docs/reference/api.md. |
| 2026-05-16 | Two-file env config split (`feat/env-config-split`): added `.env.shared` (committed, propagates via `git pull`) containing all shared tuning knobs — `MODEL_TYPE`, `BROKER`/`BROKER_MODE`, all `TRADE_*`, `AUTO_TRADE_*`, `SCANNER_*`, `CACHE_TTL_*`, usage limits, `ENVIRONMENT`, `USAGE_FILE`. Secrets + machine-specific values stay in `.env` (gitignored). `docker-compose.yml` now loads `env_file: [.env.shared, .env]`; Pydantic `Settings.Config.env_file` updated to `(".env.shared", ".env")`. `.env.example` slimmed to credentials-only template with a pointer to `.env.shared`. `docs/development/dev.md` SEC:ENV_VARS rewritten with two-file table + per-file snippets. Critical Rule #3 updated to reference `.env.shared`. |
| 2026-05-15 | Scanner log portability fix (`fix/scanner-log-portability`): the heartbeat + near-miss JSONL writers default their path relative to the source file — inside the Docker container that resolved to `/local_debugging` (ephemeral, never on the host), so on the laptop the logs were silently lost and `eod_dump.py` reported `log_exists: false`. `docker-compose.yml` now sets `SCANNER_HEARTBEAT_LOG` + `NEAR_MISS_LOG` to `/app/local_debugging/*` (the host bind mount); both documented in `.env.example` + `docs/dev.md` SEC:ENV_VARS (leave blank for local runs). Also: dip-scanner live score gate is now env-tunable via `SCANNER_SCORE_THRESHOLD` (default 72, unchanged behaviour) — wired into `_score_etf` and the backfill `_append` gate so live + backtest stay aligned; `/dip-scanner/config` now reports the real threshold (was hardcoded 65). Teed up for a 72→70 trial during market hours — flip the env, restart, no rebuild. New `_run_eod_dump` APScheduler job (CronTrigger, Mon-Fri 4:35 PM ET) subprocesses `local_debugging/eod_dump.py` so the Docker-only laptop generates the daily `eod_signals/<date>.json` with no manual `docker compose exec`; script located via `LOG_DIR`. Manual run still works: `docker compose exec backend python local_debugging/eod_dump.py [--date YYYY-MM-DD]`. |
| 2026-05-14 | Phase 3 auto-paper-trade + frontend sprint batch (uncommitted, staged in `local_debugging/push_plan.md` for tomorrow's push). New `services/trading/auto_trade.py` subscriber converts allowlisted `scanner_alerts` into bracket paper orders through the same risk caps the manual route uses, idempotent on `client_order_id="auto-{alert.id}"`. Scanner halt: dip + MCF scanners skip ticks once today's `scanner_alerts` ≥ `SCANNER_DAILY_SIGNAL_CAP=50`. New env: `AUTO_TRADE_ENABLED` (off by default), `AUTO_TRADE_SIGNAL_TYPES` (allowlist), `AUTO_TRADE_POLL_SECONDS=30`. `TRADE_DAILY_ORDER_COUNT_CAP` bumped 20 → 50. New `GET /broker/auto-trade/status` endpoint feeds an inline banner on `/portfolio`. New `<PortfolioRiskPanel>` shows total exposure, concentration warnings, max loss if all stops hit. `+ New Order` button on `/portfolio` (closes the Phase 2 hole — modal was rendered but had no trigger). Live usage pills (tokens + api %) in top nav, polled every 30s from `/usage/today`. Screener universe expanded 30 → 142 across 5 named pools (`backend/app/tools/universe.py`). `PreTradeScorecard` gains a plain-English summary line. `eod_dump.py` extended to surface `broker_orders` + alert↔order coverage + slippage. `docs/trading.md` SEC:PHASES restored to 3 phases — **live trading explicitly removed from the roadmap** (code path exists in `BROKER_MODE=live` but no sprint planned). `.env`/`.env.example` reformatted so all comments live above their variables (Docker Compose env_file parser doesn't strip inline `#`). |
| 2026-05-14 | Trading Phase 2 shipped: server-side risk caps (`services/trading/limits.py` — per-order $, per-position $, daily order count, daily realised loss via `account.equity - account.last_equity`), full `/broker/*` route set (POST orders with cap enforcement + idempotent client_order_id, GET positions/orders/clock, DELETE cancel), `BrokerOrder` rows persisted *before* the broker call so a mid-flight failure still leaves evidence of intent. Frontend: `/portfolio` page (account header + positions + open orders + fills, polls every 10s), `OrderTicketModal` (buy/sell with bracket + live-mode typed confirmation + cap-rejection copy mapping), `BrokerStatusBadge` in top nav, and a `Trade Signal →` button on `DipScannerCard` that pre-fills the modal from scanner entry/stop/target. |
| 2026-05-14 | New `docs/trading.md` plans broker integration (paper trading first, live after sign-off). Provider-agnostic via `BROKER` + `BROKER_MODE` env vars mirroring the LLM factory shape; Alpaca implementation first. Three phases: foundation (factory + smoke route + DB model), manual paper trading (portfolio page + order ticket), auto-trade behind feature flag. Risk caps (`TRADE_MAX_ORDER_DOLLARS` etc.) defined as their own service alongside `services/usage/limits.py`. |
| 2026-05-14 | Scanner data-quality batch (`fix/scanner-data-quality`): backtest `_append` now applies the live score gate (≥72, ≥80 in lunch_drift) — previously ORB/VWAP/Failed-Breakdown paths persisted sub-72 signals, polluting the 60-day baseline; near-miss writer stamps the bar's intraday timestamp (was using `datetime.now()`, producing all-16:01 entries on backtest replays) and dedups on (date, ticker, window, time, score); new heartbeat log (`scanner_heartbeat.jsonl`, configurable via `SCANNER_HEARTBEAT_LOG`) records each scan tick with status / candidates / duration so EOD can distinguish a stalled scanner from a quiet market — wired into `eod_dump.py` analysis prompts. |
| 2026-05-12 | New Market Context First (MCF) Funnel Scanner added alongside Dip Scanner. Separate `/mcf` dashboard. Uses 3-layer checking logic with SPY/QQQ/IWM/DIA to predict entries with ~1% targets. DB caching implemented to avoid `yfinance` rate limits. |
| 2026-05-12 | Docs sweep: rewrote SEC:DIP_SCANNER (features.md) for current scanner reality — 4 signal types (incl. failed_breakdown), ATR-based stops/targets, regime gate, time stop, dedup, fmd backfill, near-miss logging, AI signal analysis; SEC:DIP_SCANNER_ROUTES (api.md) adds /similar /ticker-history /analyze /chart routes; SEC:DB_MODELS (architecture.md) adds full ScannerAlert schema with signal_type + five_min_direction + resolved_by; new docs/rules.md codifies operating rules (docs discipline, git workflow, code conventions, TZ) + tracks known doc debt; CLAUDE.md gains Critical Rule #8 referencing rules.md |
| 2026-05-08 | Scanner quality sprint (Opus ideas #3,#4,#6,#16,#21,#30): hammer weight +15→+5 with stricter volume+wick definition; VIX slope scoring replaces VIX level (rising VIX = -10, falling = +12); hard lunch block score<80; WHITELIST_CELLS scaffold (disabled, enable at n≥5/cell); invalidation field in signal payload (price_close_below/vix_above/rvol_resurge); frontend "Risk $X → Make $Y" as primary P&L; invalidation line below chart |
